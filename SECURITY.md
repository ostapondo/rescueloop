# Security policy

RescueLoop watches failures and can apply approved repairs, so security reports are taken seriously.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository. Do not open a public issue
for a vulnerability, and do not include secrets or unrelated personal data in a report.

Include the affected version or commit, the operating system, the impact, and the smallest safe way
to reproduce the problem. You can expect an acknowledgement within seven days. A fix or public
disclosure date depends on severity and complexity; the report will stay private while it is being
investigated.

## Supported versions

RescueLoop is pre-1.0 software. Security fixes are made on the latest release and the `main` branch.
Older releases may not receive patches.

## Security boundaries

- Detection is local and does not send evidence over the network.
- AI analysis is an explicit action and receives bounded, redacted evidence.
- Model output is untrusted data and never becomes arbitrary command execution.
- Repairs use allowlisted action types, exact evidence binding, dry-run, explicit approval,
  verification, and rollback where supported.
- The MCP server uses local `stdio`, is read-only, and exposes no repair, replay, rollback, shell,
  arbitrary file, secret, raw artifact, launch argument, or working-directory access.
- MCP observability is limited to bounded health, event-source, timeline, and typed local-metrics
  summaries with fixed schemas. These tools accept no paths and cannot change configuration,
  sources, telemetry, incidents, repairs, the ledger, or the disposable index.

The MCP boundary is covered by protocol initialization, discovery, invalid-input, redaction, and
absence-of-mutation-tool tests in `scripts/validate-mcp.sh`.
